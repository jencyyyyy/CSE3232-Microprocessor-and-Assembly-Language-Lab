# String Processing:

# Case Conversion and String Reversal Problems. 

1. (a) Write an assembly language program to implement a case conversion program that will 
read a string (a line of characters of letters, digits, punctuation symbols, and others) as 
input and then convert the letters into its opposite case as output. Here, the characters 
which are not belonged to letters will remain be unchanged. Your program must contain 
necessary messages for formatted input and output.
(b) Write an assembly language program to implement a string reversal program that will 
read a string (a line of characters of letters, digits, punctuation symbols, and others) as 
input and then make the reverse form of the string as output. You have to solve this 
problem in two ways such as (i) using array (ii) using stack. Your program must contain 
necessary messages for formatted input and output.


# String Searching Problems. 
2. (a) Write an assembly language program to implement a searching program that will read a 
string (a line of letters of English alphabet) as input and then find out the first capital 
letter which is occurred first and last capital letter which is occurred last in the 
alphabetical order as output. Your program will display a message with “No Capitals” 
when there is no capital letter in the string. Your program must contain necessary 
messages for formatted input and output.
(b) Write an assembly language program to implement a searching program that will read a 
string (a word of letters of English alphabet either all in uppercase or all in lowercase 
but not both) as input and then find out the longest sequence of letters in the word in 
alphabetical order. Your program must contain necessary messages for formatted input 
and output.
(c) Write an assembly language program to implement a searching program that will read 
two strings (two words of letters of English alphabet either all in uppercases or all in 
lowercases but not both) as input and then determine whether a string is a substring of 
another string or not. Your program must contain necessary messages for formatted 
input and output.


# Counting and Sorting Problems. 
3. (a) Write an assembly language program to implement a counting program that will read a 
string (a line of characters of letters, digits, punctuation symbols, and others) as input 
and then count the number of Vowels, Consonants, Digits, and Spaces in the string as 
output. Your program must contain necessary messages for formatted input and output.
(b) Write an assembly language program to implement a sorting program that will read a 
string (a word of letters of English alphabet either all in uppercase or all in lowercase 
but not both) as input and then sort the letters in the word in alphabetically (i) ascending 
order (ii) descending order. Your program must contain necessary messages for 
formatted input and output.


# Number Processing:

# Series Summation and Factorial Calculation Problems. 
1. (a) Write an assembly language program to implement a series summation program 
that will read a number N of single decimal digit (from 1 to 3) as input and then 
calculate the summation value of the series 1 + 2 + --- + N. Your program must 
contain necessary messages for formatted input and output.
(b) Write an assembly language program to implement a factorial calculation 
program that will read a number N of single decimal digit (from 0 to 3) as input
and then determine the factorial value of N. Your program must contain 
necessary messages for formatted input and output.

# Even-Odd and Prime Number Testing Problems. 
2. (a) Write an assembly language program to implement an even-odd testing 
program that will read a number N of single decimal digit (from 0 to 9) as input
and then determine whether N is an even number or an odd number. Your 
program must contain necessary messages for formatted input and output.

(b) Write an assembly language program to implement a prime number testing 
program that will read a number N of single decimal digit (from 0 to 9) as input
and then determine whether N is a prime number or not. Your program must 
contain necessary messages for formatted input and output.

# Sorting Problem. 
3. (a) Write an assembly language program to implement a sorting program that will 
read an array of numbers of single decimal digits (from 0 to 9) as input and then 
sort the numbers in (i) ascending order (ii) descending order as output. Your 
program must contain necessary messages for formatted input and output.
